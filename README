This is an early stage of development. At the moment I am using the full checkout of YUI as I decide what will be needed. Also, all of the JS and Style is in the progressive_enhancement.html file, which is sort of a test case of a presentation on... you guessed it Progressive Enhancement. Ultimately there will be external js and css.
